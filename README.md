## NAME: KAMALESH S
## REG NO: 212223040083
## USE CASE DIAGRAM:
A Library Management System (LMS) use case diagram visually represents the interactions between users and the system's key functionalities. In this diagram, actors like Librarians, Members, and Admins are connected to various use cases, showing the system's operations. Librarians can manage books, members, and lending activities, while members can search for books, borrow, and return them. Admins might have broader privileges, such as managing user roles. This diagram helps clarify the systemâ€™s functional requirements, supporting efficient design and implementation.

## ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:
This diagram depicts the Activity diagram of Libary Management System. It starts with entering the library and showing an ID, which is then verified. After verification, the user inquires about a book and searches for it. Upon finding the book, they take it and make an entry in the "take away" register. The final steps involve reading and understanding the book and ensuring it is returned on time. The chart visually organizes each step in sequence to illustrate the library borrowing process.

## SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:
The image shows a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction among three participants: a Reader, a Librarian, and a System Admin, in the process of borrowing a book from a library.

Reader enters the library and shows their ID.
The Librarian performs ID verification, and once successfully verified, the reader makes an inquiry about a book.The Librarian consults the System Admin for guidance, who assists in locating the book.The book is then found and given to the reader.The reader takes the book, and the librarian makes an entry in the records.Finally, the reader is provided with the book and, after reading, returns it to the librarian before exiting the library.
